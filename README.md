# KeyForge-BTC
KeyForge BTC is a powerful, multi-threaded Bitcoin private key scanner that can search for addresses matching a predefined target list. It supports multiple key generation modes, including random, sequential, and BIP39 mnemonic-based searches.

KeyForge BTC provides a fast and efficient way to scan vast ranges of private keys.
ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Multi-Threaded Scanning â€“ Utilizes all CPU cores for maximum speed
âœ… Multiple Key Generation Modes

    Random â€“ Brute-force random private keys

    Sequential â€“ Iterate through keys in order (useful for range scanning)

    BIP39 Mnemonics â€“ Generate keys from BIP39 seed phrases (requires wordlist)
    âœ… Supports Multiple Address Types

    P2PKH (Compressed & Uncompressed)

    P2SH (SegWit wrapped in P2SH)

    Bech32 (Native SegWit)

    Taproot (P2TR)

    P2PK (Raw Public Key)
    âœ… Custom Range Support â€“ Define start and end ranges in hex
    âœ… Real-Time Status Updates â€“ Monitor progress per thread
    âœ… Match Logging â€“ Automatically saves found keys to a file

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure & Function Overview
1. Core Components
ðŸ”¹ main()

    Handles user input (search mode, address types, key range)

    Spawns worker threads for parallel scanning

    Manages Ctrl+C graceful shutdown

ðŸ”¹ scan_loop()

    The main scanning logic for each thread

    Generates private keys based on the selected mode

    Derives Bitcoin addresses and checks against target list

    Logs matches to a file

ðŸ”¹ Key Generation Functions

    generate_keypair_random() â€“ Creates random private keys within a range

    generate_keypair_sequential() â€“ Increments keys sequentially

    generate_bip39_keypair() â€“ Derives keys from BIP39 mnemonics

ðŸ”¹ Address Derivation (generate_addresses())

    Converts private keys into multiple Bitcoin address formats

    Supports legacy, SegWit, and Taproot addresses

ðŸ”¹ Helper Functions

    load_targets_to_memory() â€“ Reads target addresses from a file

    load_bip39_wordlist() â€“ Loads BIP39 words for mnemonic generation

    wif_from_sk() â€“ Converts a private key to WIF format

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Rust (Install via rustup.rs)

    Bitcoin development libraries (bitcoin, secp256k1, bip39)

Installation

    Clone the repo:
    sh

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/keyforge-btc.git
cd keyforge-btc

Build the project:
sh

    cargo build --release

Usage

    Prepare a target file (targets.txt) with Bitcoin addresses (one per line).

    Run the scanner:
    sh

    cargo run --release

    Follow the prompts to select:

        Search mode (Random/Sequential/BIP39)

        Address types to check

        Key range (for sequential mode)

        Path to BIP39 wordlist (if using mnemonics)

Example Output
